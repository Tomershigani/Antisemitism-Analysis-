# Analyzing Antisemitic Trends using Pandas and CloudWords
This project showcases in my work as a volunteer for the Fighting Online Antisemitism Association.
Using the association's database, I analyzed trends in antisemitic posts to gain insight into the scope and nature of online hate speech.

To perform this analysis, I utilized the Pandas library and CloudWords, which allowed me to clean and process the data effectively.
I encountered several challenges along the way, such as dealing with punctuation marks, multiple languages, and irrelevant data,
but was able to overcome them through careful data cleaning and preprocessing.

Overall, this project demonstrates part of my skills in data analysis and manipulation.
